# AssistantLaunchPack – v1.2 Launch Handoff

**Source System:** Streamlit Audit Guard  
**Version:** v1.2-prebundle  
**Handoff Date:** 2025-04-14  
**Focus:** Productivity & Execution Readiness (Monetization to follow)

---

## Objective

Provide `AssistantLaunchPack` with deploy-ready, production-grade assistants that have already passed:

- Structural validation
- Placeholder scan
- UI integrity check
- Runtime readiness
- Launch scoring

---

## Deliverables

| File                        | Description |
|-----------------------------|-------------|
| `v1_master_registry.csv`    | Full registry with `Launch_Score`, `Final_Status`, `Validated_By` |
| `deployable_assistants.csv` | Filtered assistants marked as `Final_Status = Ready` |
| `v1.2-enhancement_log.md`   | Audit trail of all features completed in this release |
| `streamlit_audit_guard_v1.2-prebundle.zip` | Full deployable package including all Streamlit modules |

---

## Use Recommendations

- Bundle assistants in `deployable_assistants.csv` into ZIPs for packaging
- Use `Launch_Score` to sort or prioritize build queue
- Route any agents/tools to LangChain or CLI packs
- Post-deployment, update registry via `Validated_By = LaunchPack`

---

## Next Steps

- Implement `launcher_zip_packager.py` to create auto-ZIP per assistant row
- Trigger CLI-based validator on launch
- Optionally return success status to `StreamlitAuditSystem` for logging

---

**This marks the first handoff between audit → launch pipelines.**
